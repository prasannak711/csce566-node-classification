# CSCE 566 Final Project — Problem 4  
## Graph Representation Learning and Node Classification  
### DeepWalk vs GCN on Cora and Citeseer

This repository contains my final project implementation for **CSCE 566 – Data Mining**.  
The goal is to compare two widely-used graph learning methods:

- **DeepWalk** (unsupervised random-walk embeddings)
- **GCN (Graph Convolutional Network)** (supervised message passing)

on the standard **Cora** and **Citeseer** citation networks.
